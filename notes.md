# notes on hegemony:
qawwali are mucisians who sing in sufi gatherings
sound recording first came in 1930's
Gramaphone Company targeted Muslims and Urdu since it was the predominant language
GCI focused on elite audience and mainly at the common populatoin through religion
qawwali's considered "whoelsome", "easy to understand" and appealed
to women
appeal to shared identity through wide broadcasting
*very important* - the content of the qawwali shifted over time as from 
typical orthodox (I assume sunni) to Sufi Islam to appeal to everyone against the british (page 6)

# Romanticism article

"As long as our community does not,
by means of English education, become familiar with the exactness of thought
and unlearn the looseness of expression’, Sayyid Ahmad affirmed, ‘our language
cannot be the means of high moral and mental training"
-sayyid ahmed circa late 1800's

Emphasis on "western thought" as a superior linguistic construct

English is modernity for Sayyid
English considered important to understand science law etc.

colonists tried to change the language and the poetry 

good verse 

We of the East break our enemies’ heads,
Whereas they of the West change their opponents’ nature.

Poetry had to change form the form of the mughal aristocracy to a more modern form
that took away "over-reliance on ornate and exaggerated forms of expression
(familiar to the Orientalist depiction of Mughal rulers as decadent and effete)"
# Data on modern pakistanis listening to music

large amount of pakistanis listen to music as opposed to playing it
which is in direct contrast to western civilization

However, although pakistnis like traditional type music like ghazals 
and whatnot, wester pop music is very popular as well

*however*, other forms of music are not popular such as reggae/soul.
Speaks to the marketing of this music to this demographic perhaps?

Music does conform to gender stereotype, aka Girls would rather chat with parents, cook, than listen to music but not do "boyish" things like play 
computer games. 

Culturally, creating music/playing music is more ingrained and Pakistanis 
would only do so for purely internal reasons as opposed to factors 
like cultural pressure, of which basically non exists.

pakistani music is being "westernized"
