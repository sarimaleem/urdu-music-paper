# notes on hegemony:
qawwali are mucisians who sing in sufi gatherings
sound recording first came in 1930's
Gramaphone Company targeted Muslims and Urdu since it was the predominant language
GCI focused on elite audience and mainly at the common populatoin through religion
qawwali's considered "whoelsome", "easy to understand" and appealed
to women
appeal to shared identity through wide broadcasting
*very important* - the content of the qawwali shifted over time as from 
typical orthodox (I assume sunni) to Sufi Islam to appeal to everyone against the british (page 6)

# Romanticism article

"As long as our community does not,
by means of English education, become familiar with the exactness of thought
and unlearn the looseness of expression’, Sayyid Ahmad affirmed, ‘our language
cannot be the means of high moral and mental training"
-sayyid ahmed circa late 1800's

Emphasis on "western thought" as a superior linguistic construct

English is modernity for Sayyid
English considered important to understand science law etc.

colonists tried to change the language and the poetry 

good verse 

We of the East break our enemies’ heads,
Whereas they of the West change their opponents’ nature.

Poetry had to change form the form of the mughal aristocracy to a more modern form
that took away "over-reliance on ornate and exaggerated forms of expression
(familiar to the Orientalist depiction of Mughal rulers as decadent and effete)"
# Data on modern pakistanis listening to music

large amount of pakistanis listen to music as opposed to playing it
which is in direct contrast to western civilization

However, although pakistnis like traditional type music like ghazals 
and whatnot, wester pop music is very popular as well

*however*, other forms of music are not popular such as reggae/soul.
Speaks to the marketing of this music to this demographic perhaps?

Music does conform to gender stereotype, aka Girls would rather chat with parents, cook, than listen to music but not do "boyish" things like play 
computer games. 

Culturally, creating music/playing music is more ingrained and Pakistanis 
would only do so for purely internal reasons as opposed to factors 
like cultural pressure, of which basically non exists.

pakistani music is being "westernized" 

# BBC article

Something something clash of cultures

# williams soundtrack

Each season is released as a series of episodes featuring three to four music videos, accompanied by Behind the Scenes videos

Coca-Cola Pakistan markets itself as producing drinks that unite people across classes and cultures, and appeals to the romantic idea that music is a universal
language


# Berkeley 

Coke studio started out in Brazil I guess.

Coke spent 6.8b on marketing

The idea is that special bonds are created by appealing to developing cultures.

# medium article

*important* idea of Fusion, mixing western and eastern music together

catered to ethos of being original

"A fusion of western music (Hip hop, Rock and Pop) and eastern folk songs (Sufi, Qawwali, Ghazal, Punjabi) to bring the Pakistani pride back. A fusion of unknown, young artists (Meesha Shafi, Ali Zafar, Komal Rizvi) with the famous, classical, folk and Sufi artists (Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Arif Lohar, Abida Parveen)"

Sufism as an antidote to extremism

Coke Studio aided in catapulting Coca-Cola Company from being a small player to taking up 42% of the market share (in retail volume) in Pakistan in 2018 with Pepsi being a close second at 38%, according to Euromonitor. But moreover, Coke had now gained positive associations to its brand, it had captured a considerable share of the consumer’s mind and had struck the right cords to elicit an emotional response from its consumers

quote:
The Musharraf regime’s solution to promoting a moderate image of the nation
while staying true to its Islamic heritage was Sufism, an “Islam of peace.”
Projecting a peaceful Pakistan had to be done visibly, and so Sufi practices
were turned into forms of cultural tourism, commodifying it.

TODO list for final draft: 

Great work on this Sarim! I only have a few suggestions because you have a
pretty well-written paper alredy! My main thoughts surround the depth you go in.
Like I mentioned at a few points in the comments, there are alot of aspects to
this that could use a little more detail and maybe additional perspectives to
support your argument. The changes in reintroduction or the language barrier as
examples. Those are two I would definitely recommend seeing if there are any
other aspects that you didn't touch on. And then in general, picture your
research alongside your thesis points. Are there any connections between them
that you missed? Does this article explain a different side of this point that
you haven't touched on yet? Ask yourself those questions to start digging deeper
into each of your points! Nice work overall!

[ ] Additional perspective for Sufi culture
[ ] Additional perspecive on language
[ ] IDK what else ??
