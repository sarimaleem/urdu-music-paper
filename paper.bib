    annotation = {The main focus of this article is on the language, and how it changed
        overtime under colonial rule. The Pakistani people greatly prides itself
        on the elegance of the urdu language, and so it is very important to
        study how it various people in authority attempted to change its
        literary form during the rule of the British to reform it to make it
        more "modern" or "Romantic". Since oftentimes, Qawwali's are simply
        performances poems, it's clear that the literary medium is intricately
        tied to the musical culture of the Pakistani people.The article begins
        by talking about the British reformers who attempted to change the Urdu
        literary culture and how the reformers viewed English is a superior and
        precise language in comparison to Urdu. I intend to incorporate this
        research into my article by trying to elucidate the role of language on
        music and culture.  Some other questions I want to look into are how
        specifically colonists attempted to change the language, and how that
        changed the nature of music.}

    form of Sufi music that started to become popular in the 1930's with the
    advent of radio. The article talks about the history of the qawwali and how
    they evolved from mainly Islamic hymns and praises to a general appeal to
    humanism throught the Indian subcontinent. The article also talked about the
    target demographics of the Qawwali and a general history of how they
    appeared. I intend to use this source to show how colonialism impacted music
    and culture and how the music was a common binding force against
    imperialism. Some other questions that I think I will find useful are how
    music in the modern day has influences from colonial rule. And also, since
    there is no greater tension between India and Pakistan, has music evolved to
    reflect that tension as opposed to the elements of humanism present in
    Qawwali's.}

  title={Importance of Music for Pakistani Youth.},
  author={Rana, Shabbir Ahmad and Ajmal, M and North, Adrian Charles},
  journal={Pakistan Journal of Social \& Clinical Psychology},
  volume={9},
  number={1},
  year={2011},
  annotation={This article is a largely quantitative article that gives details on how music
    affects modern Pakistani's. It surveys the youth, including men and women, and
    asks various questions like their preference to music as opposed to other
    activies like cooking, cleaning, or going to the mall.  There were a few
    interesting findings from this article in my opinion. The first is that a
    large amount of Pakistanis listen to music however vary few actually play
    instruments, which is contrast to western cultures. This shows that there may
    be a stigma against playing music in Pakistnai cultures or that is scene as a
    recreational activity rather than a serious activity. Other important topics
    that the study touches upon are how traditional gender roles in society can
    impact how what sort of activities each gender would do as opposed to
    listening to music (for example women would rather cook but not play computer
    games). This study touches on the more modern aspects of music in Pakistan how
    globalization has impacted it (aka more western pop), which is certainly an
    aspect of music I'd like to include in my article. Other things that I'd
    consider are how wester culture influenced the music itself philosophically.}

    annotation = {From the popular bollywood movie 3 idiots, this song (and the movie in
      general) is about academic pressure and a clash between eastern and
      western cultures. Generally in the Indian subcontinent, studying and
      grades are taken extremely seriously, pushing many students to the brink.
      However, this song express fraustration with the narrative that one always
      must be studying or be a part of the rat race of life. Rather, the main
      character (and the singer of this song) sings about taking life easy and
      focus on learning and understanding (important values in western pedagogy)
      as opposed to rote learning. One way I'd incoorporate this song into my
      article is by perhaps outlining some of the more positive aspects that
      western influence has bought to Indian cultures, especially when it comes
      to not participating in the rat race of life and enjoying it. Other
      questions I'd like to explore is how much influence bollywood takes from
      western culture, and whether that influence is percieved as positive or
      negative.

    annotation={This article largely explains bollywood music and how it was influenced by
      Western Culture. The article talks about a clash of cultures between the 
      West and India. One on hand, the modern generation is attracted towards
      modern values such as free love, freedom to choose sexuality or careers 
      and there is also a clash of traditional Indian values. As such, a lot of 
      these films take place in foreign countries and since there is typically 
      romance involved, there is a clash between the values of the two main 
      characters in terms of their core values. Although this article is more
      about film than song, the two are intricately related in the bollywood
      medium and you can't have one without the other. I'm probably going to
      integrate this source by focusing on the clash of cultures and values
      between the West and the East, and how in many ways this clash is
      reminicent of an old clash between Eastern music and Colonialism before
      the independence of the subcontinent.},
