        The main focus of this article is on the language, and how it changed
        overtime under colonial rule. The Pakistani people greatly prides itself
        on the elegance of the urdu language, and so it is very important to
        study how it various people in authority attempted to change its literary form during
        the rule of the British to reform it to make it more "modern" or
        "Romantic". Since oftentimes, Qawwali's are simply performances poems, it's clear that the literary medium
        is intricately tied to the musical culture of the Pakistani people.

 annotation = {The contents of this article focus on the Qawwali form of music, which was a
    form of Sufi music that started to become popular in the 1930's with the
    advent of radio. The article talks about the history of the qawwali and how
    they evolved from mainly Islamic hymns and praises to a general appeal to
    humanism throught the Indian subcontinent. The article also talked about the
    target demographics of the Qawwali and a general history of how they
    appeared. I intend to use this source to show how colonialism impacted music
    and culture and how the music was a common binding force against
    imperialism. Some other questions that I think I will find useful are how
    music in the modern day has influences from colonial rule. And also, since
    there is no greater tension between India and Pakistan, has music evolved to
    reflect that tension as opposed to the elements of humanism present in
    Qawwali's.}
